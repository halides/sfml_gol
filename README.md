# sfml_gol

Done on Ubuntu 20.04.1 Focal Fossa. You need libsfml-dev:

`sudo apt-get install libsfml-dev`

I did not try to re-invent the wheel: I looked at 3 different Game of Lifes implemented in C++, all of which were quite "C-style". I almost went with SDL2 but once I got a look at an SFML-project it seemed a lot cleaner to implement a GUI with it, at least at this scale.

I'll try to commit often so you can get a feel of how I build things.
